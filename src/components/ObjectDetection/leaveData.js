    name: "Red Spider Mite",
    description:
      "Red spider mite-affected leaves develop reddish brown markings on the upper surface, which turn red in extreme infestations, inhibiting the plant's photosynthesis. Some factors that affect the population of red spider mites. If the temperature rises, so does the level of infestation. Mites are washed away from the host by prolonged or heavy rain of large raindrops. The higher the number of hours of sunlight, the higher the percentage of infestation",
    symptoms: [
      "Reddish brown spot develop at the point of feeding ",
      "Brown patches are formed as a result of repeated sucking",
      "In severe cases leaves dry up and fall of",
    ],
    solution: [
      "Restrict cattle trespass and the pluckers from entering the un-infested areas from infested fields. Arrange plucking first in uninfested section to stop dispersal of red spider mite to healthy section",
      "The bushes in ill drained or waterlogged are more prone to RSM: Maintain proper drainage. Tea bushes suffering from water logged conditions are weak and more liable to red spider mite infestation. So, proper improvement of drainage should be done to get rid of the problem",
      "While spraying, coverage of both surfaces of foliage is necessary. During high cropping seasons control measures should be undertaken as spot treatment only.",
      "Spot spraying and safer pesticides should be applied to encourage natural enemies populations like lady bird beetle, green lace wing, predatory mites, etc.",

    name: "Helopeltis",
    description:
      "The Tea Mosquito Bug(Helopeltis) only attacks the young shoots that make up the actual crop of tea. They inject toxic saliva which causes breakdown of tissues around the site of feeding. Changes in colour is observed in affected leaves, translucent and light brown. Leaves may even curl-up. The tender stems develop cracks and over-callusing, causing growth and sometimes die-back of the stems. Helopeltis can be found on tea bushes almost all year, but in Northeast India, the occurrence peaks in June and July, sometimes stretching into September, when the number of rainy days is at its highest. Adults of these insects suck sap from terminal twigs, buds and leaves by piercing the plant tissues with their mouth styles besides injecting toxic substances present in their saliva.As a result of this injury, the leaves become curled up and deformed. The feeding punctures on leaves appear as reddish brown spotsEventually the terminals of tea bushes will dry up leading to total loss of the crop. The process of egg laying also causes damages to the tender tissues.These insects are active from January to September. Their damage is predominant in moist and shaded areas especially after monsoon showers.",

    solution: [
      "By spraying DDT (0.1%) and malathion (0.1%) the insect population can be controlled",
      "Biological control includes introduction of hyperparasite, Agamermisparadecandata (stainer) which parasitizes the nymphal stage of the mosquito bug.",
      "Plants growing in soil having a high ratio of available potash to available phosphoric acid show less infestation of this pest. Therefore, cultivation of tea plants in appropriate soil is advisable to keep the pest population under control.",
      "It includes collection and destruction of adult mosquito bugs by hand net",

    name: "Red Rust",
    description:
      "Alga causes red rust, which appears as orange-yellow irregular spots on the leaf's upper surface. Patches can be small or large, clustered or scattered, and can cover a large area of the vine. Wind or water splashing back up into the leaves spreads the disease. 4-8 hours of low light intensity, warm temperatures, and moisture humidity, such as dew or fog, are favourable to rust diseases, accompanied by 8-16 hours of high light intensity, high temperatures, and slow drying of leaf surfaces.",
    symptoms: [
      "The algae Cephaleuros parasiticus causes red rust, which is the most common disease in tea gardens.",
      "The leaves of tea plants infected with red rust disease become multicoloured (yellow or white).",
      "In severe situations, red rust kills stem tissues in areas, causing serious harm to young tea plants. Small spores are produced by the algae, which may be seen on the stems of tea plants.",
      "The sporangia at the top of the hyphae, similar to the vegetative body, generate the spores. After maturation, the sporangia are readily removed and spread by wind, rain, and dew to healthy tea plants and other host plants such as Bogamedeloa, Albizia moluccana, A odoratissima, and others, releasing spores",
      "Under severe soil and temperature circumstances, red rust may damage both young and elderly tea plants. Poor fertility, alkalinity, and lack of aeration of the soil, hard pan, insufficient or total lack of shade, dryness, and waterlogging are all predisposing factors for the illness.",
      "The illness is widespread in the North-East Indian, Sri Lankan, and Bangladeshi zones.Young tea, elderly tea plants in seed bars, and untidy tea sections are the most susceptible to the illness",
      "At any stage of development, the algae might infect the branches. The algae remain dormant for a year after they infect a branch. The pathogen's fruiting bodies are formed in the next year, depending on the first rain, to control the illness, implying that potash fertiliser plays an essential part in red rust infection.",
      "The elements nitrogen and potash are essential for the development of the tea plant. Tea plants become weak and susceptible to disease when nitrogen levels are low. Potassium is necessary for the development of the bush structure as well as the stiffness of the bushes. Red rust is uncommon in the tea garden, which is treated with a balanced fertiliser mix that includes potash.",

      "All of the fungicides were suspended in water and sprayed on the stems of the bushes as a foliar spray. Near the base of the tea plants, muriate of potash (MP) was applied as a top dress. The fungus doses",
